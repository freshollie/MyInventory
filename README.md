# My Inventory

My Inventory is an Android application I wrote for my second year module "Android Development Skills". 

The app is used to keep track of a users food "Inventory". It allows the user to create meals out of the items and shows which meals the user can currently make with their inventory.

The app was written to gain the maximum marks on the markscheme as written out in the "Assignment". The report I wrote for this app can also be read in this repository.
